# This is an early release without the ability to download from the browser. Currently working on it

I'm a bit stuck. Very little programming knowledge especially web stuff. I was able to make it download but not how I wanted it. Trying to download the video via the browser downloader to make it friendly seems pretty difficult

I was able to make the browser download the video with the help of Requestly extension. Adding Referer and Content-Disposition to the response header since it doesn't have one. Else it just tries to download it as txt file. But making the Userscript do it is a problem

## Requirements

Userscripts extensions  like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

# [Click here to install](https://github.com/PatrickL546/Hydrax-Abyss.to-DownloadHelper/raw/master/Hydrax-Abyss.to-DownloadHelper.user.js)

# [Click here to go to the downloader](https://github.com/PatrickL546/Hydrax-Abyss.to-DownloadHelper-Python)
